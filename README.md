Todo:   
proper media format in sidebar and victory rather than just type    
display time taken   
allowed routes   
end page reminder in sidebar   
missing pages: studio, tag, genre, season   
skeleton loaders   

Work on pagination?   
Multiplayer   
List integration   

Limitations:   
Only top 25 instances a staff member has worked on media will be displayed per category (VA, Anime, Manga). For example, if a staff member worked on a given anime 6 times (e.g. different songs), this will count towards 6/25 of the anime cap.   
Only top 25 characters and top 25 staff on a media page will be displayed.   
Only 5 recommendations on a media page will be displayed.   

Links in character/staff bios are not clickable for now.   

Languages other than Japanese will cause issues, especially with getting correct voice actors for a character.   

The limit of 25 is the Anilist limit of items per request, and to guard against ratelimiting and breaking the game, the total number of requests should be limited.   
The limit of recommendations is to ideally not trivialise the game or create 'metas' that do not directly use information from a given media. These may also change over time so should not be relied upon.
